# D1_Control

## Adding Pyroki IK supports

Pyroki is added as submodules. To do a new clone:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/juexZZ/D1_Control.git
```

To update the already cloned repo:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

NOTE that pyroki is tied to a specific commit head `f234516fe12c57795f31ca4b4fc9b2e04c6cb233` to adhere to the development time (summer 2025) 

For pyroki env installation, refer to their (repo)[https://github.com/chungmin99/pyroki]
